                <h1>Project Problem and Context</h2>
                  <h2 id="mid-header">Context</h3>
                  <p>I designed and developed this project in the Fall of 2022 for the UMiami Center of Ethics and Public Service in support of their civil rights lawsuit over resegregation practices in the West Grove neighborhood of Miami-Dade County. EJ Miami-Dade is an interactive map that allows city residents, judges, and policymakers to see different environmental and public health conditions and socioeconomic factors on a neighborhood tract level, and specifically, see that environmental and public health outcomes are worse in marginalized communities.

                    <h2 id="mid-header">Design Problem</h3>
                    <p>During my research and interviews with community partners at UMiami, I found that <b>residents, judges, and policymakers aren’t aware of differential environmental neighborhood conditions</b> because of a lack of data literacy and the shortcomings of existing data presentations
                    <h2 id="mid-header">Design Solution:</h2>
                    <p>An interactive map that allows users to search and explore environmental, health, and socioeconomic factors across Miami-Dade county. The product is live right now at <a href="https://www.environmentaleq.com/" target="_blank">this website</a>.

                <h2 id="mid-header">Research and Partner Interviews</h3>
                  <p>From discussions with the community partners at the UMiami Center of Ethics and Public Service and research on existing data visualizations, an interactive map emerged as the best solution to the problem. Static maps and graphs aren’t effective at demonstrating data granularly, something the community partners emphasized in the interviews. 
                    <br><br>I also found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opportunityatlas.org/">The Opportunity Atlas</a> as a precedent for a visualization with data similar to that I needed to show. </p>
                    <h2 id="mid-header">Iterative Process</h3>
                      <p>Even while time was severely constrained due to the need to both design and develop the product in 10 weeks, I still was able to use an iterative approach to the design, as shown below:</p>

Listening to users and advisors allowed this project to develop positively, a lesson that I will apply to the rest of my design work. <br><br>
                      Additionally, throughout this project, I was forced to explore the tension between development and design and think about my own biases. As this was an independent project that I had to design and develop, I had to ensure that my own ideas about what would be feasible or easy to develop wouldn’t constrain the creation of the design. From this project I learned the importance in compartmentalizing these elements to ensure the best product is ultimately built.
